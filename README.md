Our chatbot is designed to assist users with their visa-related questions and concerns. It uses natural language processing(NLP) and machine learning (ML)
to understand user queries and provide relevant information on visa types, requirements, and processes.
In short, our chatbot provides a convenient and efficient way for users to obtain visa-related information and guidance.
